# Universal Flutter Music Player Sample

The goal of this sample is to show how to implement an audio media app that works across all platforms using Google's Flutter Framework. This sample takes inspiration from [UAMP](https://github.com/android/uamp).

This [tutorial](https://github.com/ryanheise/audio_service/wiki/Tutorial) by @ryanheise is a good starting resource before playing around with this sample. It explains the key concepts that were used in this sample.
